When running this program, you should do the following:

1) Create a Kml directory and a Txt directory
2) The Txt directory should contain all the GPS .txt files provided by professor

Recommendation:
1) I recommend that you create your own branch, so that you can check for merge conflicts before commiting to the master branch
2) The .gitignore file should ignore Kml and Txt directory when you commit to this branch.

Running the folder:
1) When you run this program, it should start putting all the parsed Kml files into the Kml directory
